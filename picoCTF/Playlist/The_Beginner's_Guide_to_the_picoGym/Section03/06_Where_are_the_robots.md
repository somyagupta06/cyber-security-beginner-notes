# Where are the Robots

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915


## Step-by-Step Solution:
-  ## 1 — What is `robots.txt` and why it matters
- `robots.txt` is a small text file at the root of a website: `https://example.com/robots.txt`  
- It tells search engines which pages **not** to index.  
- In CTFs, creators often hide clues in those "do not index" pages.  
- If a hint says "where you are not supposed to look" or mentions "robots" / "bots", check `robots.txt`.

**Example `robots.txt`:**
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /secret.html
Disallow: /images/private/
```
- This means bots should not look at `/secret.html` and `/images/private/`.  
- For CTFs, open those paths in your browser.

---

## 2 — Quick commands to check files (put in terminal or Windows WSL)
- curl http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915/robots.txt
- curl http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915/8028f.html
- wget http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915/8028f.html

> Note: Commands above are simple lines. Run them in a terminal (or paste in browser for `curl` URLs).

## 3 — Other common hidden places in CTFs (with simple examples)

| Place to check | Why creators use it | Example / how to look |
|---|---:|---|
| `robots.txt` | Tells bots not to index pages — often hides clues | open `https://site/robots.txt` |
| Hidden URLs (unlinked pages) | Not linked, but accessible if you know path | try `https://site/secret.html` |
| Page source / HTML comments | Creators hide notes or clues in comments | Right-click → View Page Source → search `<!--` |
| JavaScript files | May contain encoded strings or routes | open `/static/app.js` or linked .js files |
| Fonts (woff/woff2) | Fonts sometimes contain weird glyph mapping or embedded text | download `.woff2` and inspect or convert |
| Directories with indexes disabled | Look for guessed directories from robots or sitemap | try guessed paths shown in robots.txt |
| Images or assets | Can hide steganographic flags or filenames with clues | download and run `strings` or stego tools |

## 4 — How to inspect a font file (if you download .woff2)
- Use a font viewer or online converter, or convert to ttf then open.
- Quick checks:
- file KFOM...woff2
- hexdump -C KFOM...woff2 | head
- strings KFOM...woff2 | less

(If you see readable names like FontName or glyph names, those can be hints.)

## 5 — Simple step-by-step flow for a CTF web challenge
1. Read the hint carefully. If hint has words like "robots", "not supposed to", "bots", think `robots.txt`.  
2. Open `https://<target>/robots.txt`. Note any `Disallow:` paths.  
3. Open the disallowed path in your browser: `https://<target>/<path>`  
4. If you find more clues (encoded text, images, JS), inspect page source, linked files, and assets.  
5. Use `strings` on binaries and fonts; use online decoders for base64, rot, hex if you see weird strings.

## 6 — Example: from hint to flag (mini walkthrough)
- Hint: "What part of the website tells you where not to look?" → check `robots.txt`
- Found: `Disallow: /8028f.html`
- Open: `http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915/8028f.html`
- On that page you might see the flag or another clue (e.g., base64 text, or a link to `/hidden/secret.png`).
- If you see base64 text, decode it. If you see weird characters in an image name, download the image and run `strings` or stego tools.

## 7 — Handy commands and tools list (one-per-line, plain)
- curl http://example.com/robots.txt
- curl http://example.com/8028f.html
- wget http://example.com/8028f.html
- strings file.bin
- hexdump -C file.bin | head
- file filename
- binwalk -e filename
- base64 --decode encoded.txt > out.bin
- open TTF/WOFF with a font viewer or convert with fonttools

---

## 8 — Memory tips (how to remember this trick)
- Link the hint words: "not supposed to look" → `robots.txt`.  
- Make a short checklist for web CTFs: `robots.txt`, `page source`, `js`, `images/assets`, `fonts`.  
- After solving a few challenges, these checks become automatic.

---

## 9 — Short cheat-sheet (one-liner reminders)
- Hint mentions "robots" or "where not to look" → open /robots.txt  
- `Disallow:` lines often contain hidden URLs or folders  
- If a file is binary (fonts/images), use `strings`, `hexdump`, or specialized tools

---

## 10 — Final simple example you can copy
- Open robots: curl http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915/robots.txt  
- If it shows Disallow: /8028f.html then open: curl http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915/8028f.html
