# 🎯 Mastering Cybersecurity through Training & Practice



## 1. General Rule
- No one is born a **cybersecurity expert**.  
- **Mastery = Practice + Training (continuous learning).**  
- Skills need to be **updated** & **built upon** regularly.  



## 2. Why Training Labs are Needed?
- Practising in cybersecurity may harm real systems.  
- ✅ Solution → Use **computer lab environment** (safe & isolated).  
- Training platforms are **indispensable** for learning safely.  



## 3. Prevention > Cure
- "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."  
- Better to **learn in training** than during a **live incident**.  
- Well-trained teams → **Higher quality security** → **Fewer incidents**.  



## 4. Benefits for Organizations

### 🔹 Increased Capacity
- Training boosts team efficiency **without hiring new staff**.  
- Prepares team for real-world incidents in advance.  

### 🔹 Faster Ramp-up
- Junior staff can ramp up quickly with proper training.  
- Reduces senior staff effort in repeatedly teaching basics.  

### 🔹 Standardized Skill Levels
- Centralised training creates a **common baseline**.  
- Employees labeled with **specific skills** instead of vague "junior/senior".  
- Helps in better **task assignments** & **career planning**.  



## 5. Team Benefits

- Training fosters **teamwork & collaboration**.  
- CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions:  
  - Fun + Challenging.  
  - Builds **friendship & trust** among teammates.  
  - Team bonding helps during real incidents.  



## 6. Key Takeaways

- **Training = Safer learning environment.**  
- **Better-prepared team = Reduced incidents.**  
- **Junior + Senior both benefit** from structured training.  
- **Team-based training (CTFs) = Skills + Friendship.**

# 📘 Cybersecurity Training: Investment & ROI


## 1. Off-the-Shelf vs. Custom Training
- **Small teams** (< 20 employees): Off-the-shelf training = logical choice.  
- **Larger teams** (> 20 employees) or with **specific needs**:  
  - Customise training modules.  
  - Example: TryHackMe **Content Studio** (create/modify org-specific modules).  
- ✅ Benefit → Higher training efficacy.



## 2. Enterprise Training Needs
- Large corporations want **integration**, not standalone solutions.  
- Requirements:  
  - **SSO (Single Sign-On)** support.  
  - **Well-documented APIs** for system integration.  
- Purpose → Training fits **seamlessly** into existing software landscape.



## 3. Training = Investment
- Companies treat employees like assets → Training = asset growth.  
- Sometimes need to **convince management** → Show financial impact.


## 4. 📊 Financial Impact Example

### Situation
- Team size: 10 employees.  
- Cost per employee: $80,000/year.  
- Training improves productivity: **4%**.  

### Gains
- $80,000 × 4% = $3,200 saved per employee.  
- 10 employees → $32,000 savings.  

### Costs
- Training = $500 per employee.  
- 10 employees → $5,000 total.  

### ROI
- ROI = (Gain ÷ Cost) × 100  
- ROI = ($32,000 ÷ $5,000) × 100 = **640%** 🚀  



## 5. Proposal Writing
- Use clear financial benefits to justify training budget.  
- Example resource: “Cost savings by investing in Cyber Security training” proposal (TryHackMe).  



## 6. Vendor Selection Questions
1. Who is the training for? (background, role, topics).  
2. Does vendor have experience with similar orgs?  
3. Quality: breadth + depth of content?  
4. Unified platform? (learn + train + practice).  
5. Cost of training vs. productivity gain? (CFO perspective).  



## 7. Key Takeaway
- Cost of training = **small compared to employee salaries**.  
- Training makes team **more productive + secure**.  
- Proper vendor selection ensures **long-term ROI**.
