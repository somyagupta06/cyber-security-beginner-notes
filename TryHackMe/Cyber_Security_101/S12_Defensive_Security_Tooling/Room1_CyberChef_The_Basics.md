# CyberChef Basics 

CyberChef = Swiss Army knife for data.  
It is a **web-based tool** used for many cyber operations like encoding, decoding, encryption, and decryption.  
Think of it as a big toolbox where each tool (operation) does one specific job.



## Ways to Use CyberChef

1. **Online Access**
   - Just open CyberChef in your browser (internet required).
   - No installation needed.

2. **Offline / Local Copy**
   - Download CyberChef from GitHub (latest stable release).
   - Works on both Windows and Linux.
   - Good if you want to use it without internet.



## CyberChef Interface (Main 4 Areas)

1. **Operations Area**
2. **Recipe Area**
3. **Input Area**
4. **Output Area**


## 1. Operations Area
- Contains all the tools (operations).
- Well-categorized list, searchable.
- Hover on an operation â†’ description + Wikipedia link.

### Examples of Operations:

| Operation        | Description | Example Input â†’ Output |

- **Open folder as input** â†’ Upload entire folder.
- **Open file as input** â†’ Upload single file.
- **Clear input/output** â†’ Reset both input & output.
- **Reset pane layout** â†’ Go back to default view.



## 4. Output Area
- Shows the result of your recipe.
- Clean display of processed data.

### Features:
- **Save output to file** â†’ Export result as `.dat`.
- **Copy raw output** â†’ Copy processed data to clipboard.
- **Replace input with output** â†’ Overwrite input with new result.

# Summary
- **Operations = Tools** (Base64, Hex, ROT13, etc.)
- **Recipe = How you combine operations**
- **Input = Your data**
- **Output = Your result**

CyberChef makes encoding/decoding easy by dragging operations into the recipe and processing your data.

# CyberChef Thought Process (Step-by-Step)

Before using CyberChef operations, you should first **plan** what you are trying to achieve.  
This process has **4 steps**:



## Step 1: Set a Clear Objective
- Ask yourself: **"What do I want to achieve?"**
- This gives direction and focus.
- Example:  
  - During a security investigation, you find a strange **gibberish string**.  
  - Your objective = "Find out if there is a hidden message inside this string."



## Step 2: Put Data into Input
- Take your data (text, string, file, folder) and put it into **CyberChefâ€™s Input Area**.
- Example:  
  - Copy & paste the gibberish string into the input box.


## Step 3: Select Operations
- Decide which CyberChef operations to apply.
- This can be tricky if you donâ€™t know the type of data.  
- Categories to explore include:  
  - **Encoding/Decoding** (Base64, Base85, ROT13, ROT47, Hex, etc.)  
  - **Encryption/Decryption**  
  - **Data Format Conversion**

- Example:  
  - From research, you find the string might be **encoded/encrypted**.  
  - Try operations like `ROT13`, `Base64`, or `Base85`.



## Step 4: Check Output
- Look at the output to see if your **objective is achieved**.
- Ask: **"Did I get the result I wanted?"**
- Example:  
  - If the output shows a readable hidden message â†’ Success âœ…  
  - If itâ€™s still gibberish â†’ Repeat process (go back to Step 1).



# Quick Flow (Visual Idea)

1. **Objective** â†’ Define the goal (What do I want?)  
2. **Input** â†’ Paste/upload your data  
3. **Operations** â†’ Try different tools/recipes  
4. **Output** â†’ Check results (if wrong, repeat)



# Example Walkthrough

- Found gibberish string: `U2FsdGVkX1+83uS3...`  
- **Step 1 (Objective):** Find hidden message.  
- **Step 2 (Input):** Paste string into CyberChef input.  
- **Step 3 (Operations):** Try `Base64 Decode` â†’ still gibberish.  
  - Try `ROT13` â†’ still gibberish.  
  - Try `Hex to Text` â†’ success, message is revealed.  
- **Step 4 (Output):** Objective achieved ðŸŽ‰

# CyberChef â€“ Commonly Used Operation Categories

When using CyberChef, recognizing **operation categories** makes your work faster and easier.  
Here are the most common categories:



## 1. Extractors
These operations help you pull out (extract) useful information like IPs, URLs, or emails.

| Operation              | Description | Example |
|-------------------------|-------------|---------|
| Extract IP addresses    | Finds IPv4 and IPv6 addresses | `Ping 8.8.8.8` â†’ `8.8.8.8` |
| Extract URLs            | Finds URLs from text (must have protocol like http/ftp) | `Visit https://tryhackme.com` â†’ `https://tryhackme.com` |
| Extract email addresses | Finds email addresses in the text | `Contact us: admin@tryhackme.com` â†’ `admin@tryhackme.com` |

**Tip:**  
- IPs = networking concept (address of machines).  
- Emails = format `anything@domain.com`.  
- URLs = internet resource address (like `https://example.com`).  



## 2. Date and Time
These operations are useful when working with **timestamps**.

| Operation          | Description | Example |
|--------------------|-------------|---------|
| From UNIX Timestamp | Converts UNIX timestamp â†’ readable date | `1725654622` â†’ `Fri Sep 6 20:30:22 +04 2024` |
| To UNIX Timestamp   | Converts readable date â†’ UNIX timestamp | `Fri Sep 6 20:30:22 +04 2024` â†’ `1725654622` |

**What is UNIX Timestamp?**  
- A number that counts seconds from **1 Jan 1970 UTC**.  
- Used by systems to represent time.


## 3. Data Format (Base Encodings & Decodings)

### Common Operations:

| Operation     | Description | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| From Base64   | Decode Base64 â†’ raw text | `V2VsY29tZSB0byB0cnloYWNrbWUh` â†’ `Welcome to tryhackme!` |
| URL Decode    | Decode `%` encoded URLs â†’ raw values | `https%3A%2F%2Fgchq%2Egithub%2Eio%2FCyberChef%2F` â†’ `https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/` |
| From Base85   | Decode Base85 â†’ text | `BOu!rD]j7BEbo7` â†’ `hello world` |
| From Base58   | Decode Base58 â†’ text (removes confusing chars l,I,0,O) | `AXLU7qR` â†’ `Thm58` |
| To Base62     | Encode text â†’ Base62 (shorter strings) | `Thm62` â†’ `6NiRkOY` |

**What is Base Encoding?**  
- Converts **binary data** (0s & 1s) into **text format**.  
- Makes data safe to share in emails, URLs, or files.  



## Manual Base64 Example (Encoding "THM")

### Step 1: Convert to Binary
Using ASCII table:  
- T = `01010100`  
- H = `01001000`  
- M = `01001101`  
Combined = `010101000100100001001101` (24 bits)

### Step 2: Break into 6-bit Chunks
`010101 000100 100001 001101`

Convert each to decimal:
- `010101` = 21  
- `000100` = 4  
- `100001` = 33  
- `001101` = 13  

### Step 3: Use Base64 Index Table
- 21 â†’ V  
- 4 â†’ E  
- 33 â†’ h  
- 13 â†’ N  

**Result:** `"THM"` â†’ `"VEhN"` in Base64 âœ…



## URL Decode Example

| Character | Encoded Value |
|-----------|---------------|
| :         | %3A |
| /         | %2F |
| .         | %2E |
| =         | %3D |
| #         | %23 |

So,  
`https%3A%2F%2Ftryhackme.com%2Froom` â†’ `https://tryhackme.com/room`



# Summary

- **Extractors** â†’ Grab IPs, Emails, URLs from text.  
- **Date/Time** â†’ Convert between human-readable and UNIX time.  
- **Data Format** â†’ Base64, Base85, Base58, Base62, URL encode/decode.  
- **Base64 Example** â†’ "THM" = "VEhN".
