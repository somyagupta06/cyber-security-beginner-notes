## 📌 Important Terms
- **SOC** → Security Operations Center  
- **SIEM** → Security Information and Event Management  
- **IPS** → Intrusion Prevention System  
- **IP Address** → Like a home address for your computer on the internet. It tells other computers where to send the info you request.

## 🛡️ Defensive Security
- **Definition:**  
  - Preventing intrusions from attackers  
  - Deleting intrusions when they occur and responding properly  

### ⚙️ Tasks Related to Defensive Security
- User cyber security awareness  
- Documenting and managing assets  
- Updating and patching systems  
- Setting up preventative security devices  
- **Firewalls** → Control what network traffic can enter/leave the system or network  
- **IPS** → Blocks network traffic matching attack signatures  
- Setting up logging and monitoring devices  

---

## 🖥️ SOC (Security Operations Center)
- Protects against and detects attacks  
- A team that monitors networks and systems to detect malicious cyber security events  

### 🕵️‍♂️ Main Areas of Interest
- Vulnerabilities  
- Policy violation → Rules set to protect network and systems  
- Unauthorized activity  
- Network intrusions  

### 🔍 Threat Intelligence
- Collects info to prepare against potential adversaries  
- Identifies threat actors and predicts their activity  
---
## 🧑‍💻 Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
**Digital Forensics** → Investigate cyber crimes and establish facts:  
- Analyzing evidence of attacks and preparation  
- Intellectual property theft  
- Cyber espionage → digital चोरियाँ  
- Possession of unauthorized content  



### 📂 Areas of Interest in DFIR
- **File Systems** → Installed programs, created files, partially overwritten files, deleted files  
- **System Memory** → When attackers run malicious programs in memory without saving to disk  
- **System / Network Logs** → Logs maintained by client and server computers

## 🚨 Incident Response
**Methodology to handle cyber attacks:**  

**Four Major Phases:**  
1. **Preparation**  
2. **Detection and Analysis**  
3. **Containment (stop), Eradication (clean), and Recovery**  
4. **Post Incident Activity**

## 🦠 Malware Analysis
**Malware** → Malicious Software (programs, scripts, files)  

### Types of Malware
1. **Virus**  
   - Attaches to programs, spreads computer to computer  
   - Alters, overwrites, or deletes files → slows down or disables system  
2. **Trojan Horse**  
   - Shows desirable function but hides malicious functionality  
3. **Ransomware**  
   - Encrypts user files  
   - Makes files unreadable without a password  
   - Attacker demands ransom to provide password  

### 🎯 Analysis Methods
- **Static Analysis** → Inspect malware without running it  
- **Dynamic Analysis** → Run malware in a controlled environment and monitor behavior

## 🧠 SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
**Definition:** Centralized security tool. Acts as CCTV + brain  

**Usage:**  
- Log collection  
- Log analysis  
- Alerting  
- Visualization  
- Reporting  

**Top SIEM Tools:**  
- Splunk  
- Wazuh  
- ELK Stack  
- AlienVault OSSIM  
- IBM QRadar
