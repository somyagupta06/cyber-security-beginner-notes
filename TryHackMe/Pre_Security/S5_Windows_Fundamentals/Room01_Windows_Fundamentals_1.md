# 🌟 Windows Basics 

# 1. Short History of Windows

Windows started in **1985**.  
Slowly-slowly many versions came:

- Windows XP → super popular  
- Windows Vista → flop (slow + many issues)  
- Windows 7 → loved by everyone  
- Windows 8 → again flop  
- Windows 10 → very stable  
- Windows 11 → current version (Home + Pro editions)

For servers, the latest version is **Windows Server 2025**.  
But in our VM, we use **Windows Server 2019 Standard**.

Microsoft keeps improving Windows for better **security** and **usability**.

# 2. What is the Windows Desktop?

After you log in, the first screen you see is called the **Desktop**.  
You must enter a **username + password** on the login screen before reaching the desktop.

<img width="610" height="637" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-07 at 6 50 38 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3b27d46-5078-4705-b18f-18fdc021856a" />

---

## ⭐ Section 2 — Apps List (Alphabetical List)

Shows:

- Recently installed apps (top)  
- All installed apps (in A-Z sections)  

If the list is long → click any **letter** to jump quickly to that alphabet.
<img width="259" height="506" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-07 at 6 51 08 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53ab341b-50fe-4147-96b2-6473aa982e6f" />

## ⭐ Section 3 — Tiles (Right Side)

These are big square icons called **Tiles**.

You can right-click any tile to:

- Resize  
- Unpin from Start

# 5. Taskbar (Bottom Bar)

Anything you open (apps, folders, browser) appears here.

Why it's useful:

- You can switch between many apps fast  
- Hover over an icon → shows preview (thumbnail)

You can right-click the Taskbar to:

- Show / hide toolbars  
- Lock taskbar  
- Open taskbar settings

# 🎯 Quick Summary Table

|-----------------|--------------|
| Desktop | Main screen where files/icons are kept |
| Start Menu | All apps + settings in one place |
| Tiles | Big app shortcuts on the Start Menu |

---

# ⭐ Super Simple Explanation (One Line Each)

- Windows = most used OS, always improving  
- Desktop = your workspace  
- Start Menu = your app store + control center  
- Taskbar = your quick switch panel  
- Notification Area = system info panel  
- Right-click everything = more options

# 🌟 Windows File System, User Accounts, Permissions, UAC, Settings, Task Manager  


---

# 1. What File System Does Windows Use?

Modern Windows uses **NTFS** (New Technology File System).

Before NTFS, Windows used:
- FAT16 / FAT32 (File Allocation Table)
- HPFS (High Performance File System)

You still see **FAT32** on USB drives and memory cards.

### ⭐ Why NTFS is Better?
NTFS is a **journaling file system** → it keeps a log, so if the computer crashes, NTFS can repair files automatically.

NTFS supports:
- Files larger than 4GB  
- File & folder permissions  
- Compression  
- Encryption (EFS)  

To check your file system:
Right-click C: drive → Properties → File System = NTFS.

---

# 2. NTFS Permissions (Very Important)

On NTFS, you can decide **who can do what** with files/folders.

### NTFS Permission Types

| Permission | What it means |
|-----------|----------------|
| Full Control | Do everything (read, write, delete) |
| Modify | Change content |
| Read & Execute | View + run programs |
| List Folder Contents | See folder items |
| Read | Only view |
| Write | Add new data |
<img width="800" height="398" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-07 at 7 01 13 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77e24627-213d-4393-bb56-a3cc95a28c52" />
### How to View Permissions?

1. Right-click a file/folder  
2. Properties  
3. Security tab  
4. Select user or group  
5. See permissions  

This is how Windows checks who is allowed to open/modify things.
<img width="668" height="473" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-07 at 7 01 40 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d09e760e-d3d1-42cc-8da6-78ac0ecd2073" />

---

# 3. NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS)

ADS = secret extra data storage inside a file.

Every file normally has one data stream → `$DATA`.

But ADS allows:
- multiple invisible streams
- Explorer does NOT show them
- Malware can hide inside ADS
- Browser also uses ADS to mark files downloaded from Internet

You will learn how to view ADS using PowerShell later.

Example (concept only):  
A file `text.txt` can secretly have another stream like:  
`text.txt:hiddeninfo`

---

# 4. The Windows Folder (C:\Windows)

This folder contains the Windows operating system.

It doesn’t have to be on **C:**.  
It can be on any drive.

To find it, Windows uses an environment variable:

%windir%

Inside Windows folder, there are many subfolders.  
The MOST important is:

### ⭐ System32  
Contains critical system files.  
If you delete anything here → Windows may stop working completely.

So, **never touch System32 unless you know what you’re doing**.
<img width="725" height="547" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-07 at 7 02 04 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b8eb91d-beb2-459d-97d3-047face54014" />
<img width="728" height="546" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-07 at 7 02 15 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b4cbbe9-9827-42e2-9a39-f8ce8e6b4ae5" />

# 5. User Account Types

Windows has **two main account types**:

| Account Type | What it can do |
|--------------|----------------|
| Administrator | Full control over system |
| Standard User | Only normal tasks (cannot change system settings) |

You are currently using an **Administrator account**.

### Where Are User Profiles Stored?

Every user gets a profile folder in:

C:\Users\Username

Example: for user Max → `C:\Users\Max`

Each profile contains:
- Desktop  
- Downloads  
- Documents  
- Pictures  

When a new user logs in the first time, Windows creates these folders.

---

# 6. Viewing Users & Groups (Local Users and Groups)

To open it:

1. Right-click Start → Run  
2. Type:  
lusrmgr.msc

Here you see:
- **Users** (all local accounts)
- **Groups** (collections of permissions)

When a user is added to a group → they inherit that group’s permissions.

Example:
- Add a user to *Administrators* → they become admin  
- Add to *Remote Desktop Users* → they can RDP  

---

# 7. UAC (User Account Control)

UAC protects Windows from malware.

Even if a user is an **Administrator**, Windows DOES NOT run everything with full power.

### How UAC Works
When something needs admin rights:

- Windows shows a **UAC popup**
- User must confirm  
- Or enter admin password (if logged in as Standard User)

### Icons with a Shield
If a program shows a **shield icon**, it needs admin permissions.

When you double-click → UAC prompt appears.

If user doesn’t approve → program will not run.

This prevents malware from auto-installing.

---

# 8. Settings vs Control Panel

Windows has two places to change system settings:

### ⭐ Settings  
Modern interface (introduced in Windows 8).  
Mostly used for:
- Background  
- Apps  
- Network  
- Updates  
- Devices  
- Accounts  

### ⭐ Control Panel  
Older interface.  
Used for advanced settings:
- Uninstall programs  
- Network adapter settings  
- User accounts  
- System settings  

Sometimes Settings sends you to Control Panel automatically.

### How to Find Anything Fast?
Use Start Menu Search.

Example: type *wallpaper* → Windows takes you to the right place.

---

# 9. Task Manager (The Doctor of Windows)

Task Manager shows:
- Running apps  
- Background processes  
- CPU/RAM usage  
- Startup programs  
- Services  

How to open:
Right-click Taskbar → Task Manager

It first opens in **Simple View** → click **More details** for full view.

Useful tabs:
- **Processes** → see what’s running  
- **Performance** → CPU, RAM, Disk, Network usage  
- **Startup** → disable apps slowing boot  
- **Users** → see what each user is running  

---

# ⭐ SUPER SHORT SUMMARY (1-Minute Revision)

- Windows uses **NTFS**, not FAT32  
- NTFS allows permissions, encryption, big files  
- System32 = VERY IMPORTANT folder  
- User profiles stored in C:\Users  
- Admin = full power; Standard User = limited  
- UAC protects system from accidental admin tasks  
- Settings = modern; Control Panel = advanced  
- Task Manager shows system health + running apps
