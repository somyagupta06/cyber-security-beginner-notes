- Ask critical questions:
  - Did attacker exfiltrate data?
  - How much data was lost?
  - Did attacker pivot to other hosts?



## 6. SOC Responsibilities Breakdown

### üîπ Preparation & Prevention
- Stay updated on latest threats (Twitter, Feedly, CISA alerts).
- Gather threat intelligence (actors, TTPs = tactics, techniques, procedures).
- Maintain defenses:
  - Update firewall signatures.
  - Patch vulnerabilities.
  - Block/allow lists (apps, IPs, emails).

### üîπ Monitoring & Investigation
- Tools: **SIEM, EDR**.
- Alerts ‚Üí Prioritised (Critical > High > Medium > Low).
- Junior Analysts = Perform **triaging**.
- Investigation mindset ‚Üí Always ask **How? When? Why?**
- Drill down into logs, alerts, OSINT.

### üîπ Response
- Contain compromised hosts (e.g., isolation).
- Terminate malicious processes.
- Delete malicious files.
- Coordinate with higher SOC tiers for escalation.

# üõ°Ô∏è Security Operations Center (SOC) Overview

---

## 1. SOC Definition
- Centralized 24/7 function in an organization.
- Uses **people, processes, technology** to:
  - Monitor
  - Detect
  - Analyze
  - Respond to cybersecurity incidents
- Acts as **central hub** for IT telemetry (networks, devices, appliances, info stores).
- Correlates every logged event ‚Üí decide how to act.

---

## 2. SOC Roles & Structure
- **SOC Manager** ‚Üí Leads SOC.
- **Staff**:
  - SOC Analysts (Tier 1, 2, 3)
  - Threat Hunters
  - Incident Responders
  - Incident Response Managers
- Reports to **CISO ‚Üí CIO/CEO**
- Architecture: **Hub-and-spoke**
  - Spokes: Vulnerability scanners, GRC systems, IPS, UEBA, EDR, TIP
