# üõ°Ô∏è Penetration Testing 

---

## What is a Penetration Test (Pentest)?
- A **pentest** is a legal, **authorised** attempt to find problems in a company's computer systems.  
- Pentesters use the same tools and tricks as bad hackers, but **with permission** to help fix problems.  
- Think: it‚Äôs like hiring somebody to try to break into your house so you can make it safer.

---

## Why Cybersecurity & Pentests Matter
- Hacks and data leaks happen a lot ‚Äî businesses and people lose money and trust.  
- Pentests show weak points before real criminals find them.  
- Good security = strong passwords, safe systems, and trained people.

---

## Is Pentesting Legal?
- **Yes, only when it‚Äôs authorised.**  
- Before any test, the pentester and the system owner sign an agreement. That agreement says **what is allowed** and **what is not**.  
- Anything outside that agreement is illegal.

---

## What Happens Before a Pentest? (Important Steps)
1. **Scope meeting** ‚Äî pentester and client agree what to test.  
2. **Rules of Engagement (ROE)** ‚Äî a written document that says how to test.  
3. **Permissions** ‚Äî formal written permission so the pentester is protected legally.

---

## Rules of Engagement (ROE) ‚Äî Main Sections
| Section | What it says (Easy) |
|--------:|---------------------|
| **Permission** | Written permission to test. Protects both sides legally. |
| **Test Scope** | Exact targets (IP, website, app). What is included and what is not. |
| **Rules** | Which techniques are allowed (e.g., can we phish staff? can we do denial-of-service?). |

---

## Ethics in Pentesting
- Even if something is **legal**, it may be **ethically** questionable (example: reading very private data).  
- Pentesters must follow the ROE and be professional.  
- If the test finds very sensitive data, the pentester should handle it carefully and report it only to the agreed parties.

## Hacker "Hats" ‚Äî Motivation & Ethics
| Hat | Who they are (Easy) | Example |
|-----|---------------------|---------|
| **White Hat** | Good hackers. Work legally and help fix problems. | A pentester hired by a company. |
| **Grey Hat** | Sometimes break rules but try to help or expose problems. Not always legal. | Someone taking down a scam site without permission. |
| **Black Hat** | Criminal hackers. Steal, damage, or extort for money. | Ransomware author demanding money. |

---

## Typical Penetration Test Flow (Short)
1. **Planning & Rules** ‚Äî agree scope and ROE.  
2. **Information Gathering** ‚Äî collect public info about the target.  
3. **Scanning** ‚Äî find open ports, services, and software versions.  
4. **Exploitation** ‚Äî try to use weaknesses to get access (only allowed ones).  
5. **Post-Exploitation** ‚Äî see what attacker could do after access (limited by ROE).  
6. **Reporting** ‚Äî write clear report with findings and fixes.  
7. **Remediation & Retest** ‚Äî client fixes issues; sometimes pentester tests again.

---

## What a Good Pentest Report Contains (Simple)
- **Summary**: Short and clear ‚Äî what was found and how bad it is.  
- **Details**: Step-by-step evidence (screenshots, commands ‚Äî but placed carefully).  
- **Risk Rating**: Low / Medium / High / Critical.  
- **Fixes**: Simple steps the company can do to fix each problem.  
- **Timeline**: When test was done and when retest can happen.

---

## Short Checklist for Pentesters (Easy)
- ‚úÖ Get written permission (ROE + Scope).  
- ‚úÖ Know which tools & techniques are allowed.  
- ‚úÖ Avoid actions that break safety or privacy rules.  
- ‚úÖ Keep detailed logs for the report.  
- ‚úÖ Communicate with the client during the test (if needed).  
- ‚úÖ Deliver a clear, friendly report with fixes.

---

## Simple Examples
- **Phishing test allowed** ‚Üí send fake phishing email to staff (if ROE allows).  
- **Phishing test not allowed** ‚Üí test stops; follow ROE.  
- **Database access found** ‚Üí collect only proof, do not copy full sensitive data; follow ROE and laws.

---

## Final Notes (Easy)
- Pentesting helps make systems safer.  
- Always follow the ROE, act ethically, and keep clear communication.  
- If you want to learn pentesting, start with permission-based labs and practice legally (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, etc.).

# üõ°Ô∏è Penetration Testing Methodology & Frameworks

Penetration tests can have **many different objectives**.  
No single methodology fits all cases.  
A **good methodology** = relevant + adaptable to the situation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Typical Pentest Stages

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Information Gathering (Recon/OSINT)** | Collect as much publicly available info about the target as possible (no scanning yet). Example: research, WHOIS, LinkedIn. |
| **Enumeration / Scanning** | Discover applications, services, ports. Example: finding a web server, open SMB shares, etc. |
| **Exploitation** | Use discovered vulnerabilities or flaws (public exploits, custom logic exploitation). |
| **Privilege Escalation** | After initial foothold, gain more access: <br>‚Ä¢ **Horizontal**: same level (other users) <br>‚Ä¢ **Vertical**: higher privilege (admin). |
| **Post-Exploitation** | Actions after compromise: <br>1. Pivot to other hosts <br>2. Gather more info as privileged user <br>3. Cover tracks <br>4. Prepare reporting. |

| Universal standard for systems & apps. | ‚Äî |

---

### 2. OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)
- Focus: **Web applications & services** only.
- Community-driven, frequently updated.
- Publishes the **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities & testing approaches.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Easy to pick up and understand. | Vulnerabilities may overlap, making classification unclear. |
| Actively maintained & updated. | Doesn‚Äôt tie into specific SDLC recommendations. |
| Covers full engagement: testing ‚Üí reporting ‚Üí remediation. | No accreditation such as CHECK. |
| Specialises in web apps. | ‚Äî |

---

### 3. NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1
- Focus: Improving organisational cybersecurity standards & managing cyber risk.
- Used by critical infrastructure and commercial organisations.
- Provides security controls, benchmarks, and guidelines (less direct pentesting methodology).

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Used by ~50% of US organisations (2020). | Multiple versions ‚Üí hard to choose correct one. |
| Extremely detailed standards to mitigate threats. | Weak auditing policies (harder to see how breach happened). |
| Very frequently updated. | Limited cloud computing consideration. |
| Provides accreditation; designed to be used alongside other frameworks. | ‚Äî |

### 4. NCSC CAF (Cyber Assessment Framework)
- UK government-backed.
- 14 principles to assess an organisation‚Äôs defences, focusing on:
  - **Data security**
  - **System security**
  - **Identity & access control**
  - **Resilience**
  - **Monitoring**
  - **Response & recovery planning**

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Backed by a government cybersecurity agency. | Still new, limited adoption so far. |
| Provides accreditation. | Principle-based (less direct ‚Äúrules‚Äù). |
| Covers wide areas (security to response). | ‚Äî |

---

## üìù Key Takeaway

- All frameworks share **core pentest stages** but differ in **focus**:
  - **OSSTMM** = wide systems & comms.
  - **OWASP** = web apps/services.
  - **NIST** = organisational security standards.
  - **NCSC CAF** = high-value/critical services & resilience.

Pick or combine frameworks based on your **target environment** and **engagement goals**.

# üîç Testing Scopes ‚Äî Easy Notes (Very Simple English)

When you test an app or service, you choose how much you already know about it.  
There are **three main scopes**: **Black‚ÄëBox**, **Grey‚ÄëBox**, and **White‚ÄëBox**.  
Which one you pick changes how you plan and run the test.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Black‚ÄëBox Testing (No inside info)
- **What it is**: Tester has **no** internal details. Acts like a regular user / attacker from outside.  
- **What tester does**: Use the app UI, click buttons, submit forms, interact like normal users, and look for vulnerabilities.  
- **Good for**: Simulating real external attackers; testing public-facing apps and services.  
- **Time**: More time in reconnaissance & scanning (to find attack surface).  
- **Pros**:
  - Realistic attacker view.
  - No need for source code or internals.
- **Cons**:
  - Slower to find deep issues.
  - May miss problems inside systems or code.
- **Example**: Testing a public website without any API keys, source code, or IP info.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Grey‚ÄëBox Testing (Some inside info)
- **What it is**: Tester has **limited knowledge** (example: account credentials, architecture diagram, or API docs).  
- **What tester does**: Use both outside testing methods and the small amount of inside info to find issues faster.  
- **Good for**: Common real-world pentests ‚Äî balance between speed and depth. Often chosen for well‚Äëhardened systems.  
- **Time**: Faster than black‚Äëbox because tester wastes less time discovering basics.  
- **Pros**:
  - Faster & more focused than black‚Äëbox.
  - Can validate specific areas using given info.
- **Cons**:
  - Not as exhaustive as white‚Äëbox.
- **Example**: Client gives tester a test user account and API documentation for a web app.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ White‚ÄëBox Testing (Full inside info)
- **What it is**: Tester has **full** internal info: source code, architecture, design docs, credentials, etc.  
- **What tester does**: Deep code review, logic checks, unit-level vulnerabilities, full coverage of attack surface.  
- **Good for**: Code audits, secure development reviews, or when you must validate everything.  
- **Time**: Most time-consuming but most thorough.  
- **Pros**:
  - Can find deep logic bugs and insecure code paths.
  - Validates entire attack surface.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires developer knowledge.
  - Takes much more time and effort.
- **Example**: Developer gives full repo and DB schema for a security code review.

## üîÅ Quick Comparison Table

| Scope      | Knowledge Level | Best For                       | Speed      | Depth of testing |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|------------|------------------|
| Black‚ÄëBox  | None            | Public external tests          | Slower     | Shallow ‚Üí Medium |
| Grey‚ÄëBox   | Some            | Typical pentest (balanced)     | Moderate   | Medium           |
| White‚ÄëBox  | Full            | Code audit / deep security     | Slowest    | Very deep        |

---

## ‚úÖ When to choose which
- **Choose Black‚ÄëBox**: You want to simulate an outside attacker with no inside help.  
- **Choose Grey‚ÄëBox**: You want a practical test with some help from the client ‚Äî common for real engagements.  
- **Choose White‚ÄëBox**: You must check code quality, logic, and every possible path (secure SDLC or compliance audits).

---

## üîé Quick Checklist for Testers (Simple)
- Get the **scope** in writing (what is allowed / not allowed).  
- Confirm **which type** (Black/Grey/White) before starting.  
- If Grey or White: list what info is provided (accounts, code, diagrams).  
- Always follow **Rules of Engagement** and legal permission.  
- Document findings and how you tested (so the client can reproduce & fix).
